              After completing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), I
              enrolled in an industry-focused, intensive training program in
              full-stack web development at NxtWave with a strong emphasis on
              the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). During
              this program, I actively gained hands-on experience by building
              real-world projects and applying modern web development best
              practices. Along with my training, I worked as a Teaching
              Assistant for 4 months within the same program period, mentoring
              learners in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I supported doubt
              resolution, conducted code reviews, and guided learners through
              project development to ensure high learning outcomes. This
              experience strengthened my full-stack technical expertise,
              problem-solving ability, communication skills, and leadership
              qualities.
