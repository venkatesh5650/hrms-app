          I am an aspiring MERN Stack Developer with a background in Bachelor of
          Computer Applications (BCA). I enjoy turning ideas into functional and
          user-friendly web applications using technologies like HTML, CSS,
          Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React. On the backend, I work with Node.js,
          Express, and databases such as SQLite and MySQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have completed intensive web development training at NxtWave and
          worked as a Teaching Assistant, helping learners with HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React. I enjoy writing clean code, learning new
          concepts, and building projects that solve real-world problems.
